About gGui
##########
gGui is a data-analysis software written to visualize astronomical data, specifically time-tagged lightcurves, coadds, and cubes. gGui serves as the primary data visualization tool for gPhoton, the data reduction pipeline for GALEX.

`The Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) Space Telescope <https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/galaxy-evolution-explorer-galex/>`_
=============================================================================================================================
`GALEX <https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/galaxy-evolution-explorer-galex/>`_ was an ultraviolet space telescope commissioned by NASA and managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) at the California Institute of Technology (CalTech). 

The data currently resides in the `GALEX Public Archive <http://galex.stsci.edu/GR6/>`_ at the Space Telescope Science Institute's (`STScI <http://stsci.edu/>`_) Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (`MAST <https://archive.stsci.edu/>`_).

`gPhoton <https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/gphoton/>`_
======================================================
`gPhoton <https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/gphoton/>`_ is a project to calibrate, archive, and make available every photon event observed by the GALEX mission in an effort to dramatically improve the flexibility and utility of the data with specific emphasis on enabling short time domain photometric studies.
